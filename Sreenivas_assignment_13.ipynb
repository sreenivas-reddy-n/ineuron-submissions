    "1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Excel, spreadsheets can have values of data types other than strings. cells can have different fonts, sizes, or color settings. cells can have varying widths and heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is used to displays the data in horizontal and vertical rows. The data are usually stored in the cells. We have an option of formulas in Excel that can be used for data and its place of storage. we can even add any charts, graphics, etc. to make it more presentable.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV file canâ€™t perform operations on data while Excel can perform operations on the data.\n",
    "It also provides the user option for external linking of data from other sources and also the user can do custom add-ins. No such feature is available in CSV format when it is compared with Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier for the end user to read large files compared to csv file.\n",

    "Files saved in excel format can not be edited by other text editors and alos Excel files are password protected. But csv files can be changed by other editors also and csv files are not password protected.\n",
